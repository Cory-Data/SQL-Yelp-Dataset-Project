# SQL-Yelp-Dataset-Project
# Using SQL to profile and analyze a sample Yelp dataset.
This project is an attempt to showcase a rounded SQL skillset. Here, I'm working with a sample dataset from Yelp and using DBMS SQLite. Each table consists of 10,000 records. The ER Diagram for the relational database is included as a png file. You will find the profiling and analysis of the dataset in the pdf file, along with the code, comments, and output from SQLite.
